# oGX-Applications-Automation
The provided Google Apps Script automates data extraction and updating processes from the AIESEC Global Information System (GIS) API into Google Sheets, specifically focusing on oGX applications. The `dataExtraction` function executes GraphQL queries to retrieve oGX opportunity application data based on specified filters like creation date and program types. The `dataUpdating` function manages the automation process by fetching data using defined GraphQL queries, identifying new entries or updates, and appending new rows or updating existing ones in the "1Applications" sheet. It includes error handling and logging for robust execution and updates the "Interface" sheet to record execution status and timestamps. The `onOpen` function sets up a custom menu in the spreadsheet interface to enable manual execution of the `dataUpdating` function. Together, these scripts streamline data management tasks, ensuring real-time updates and efficient tracking of oGX applications within Google Sheets.
